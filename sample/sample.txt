Short Title
Longer meaningful title of document
Third line will go in [notes] by default

1 Heading

1.1 Sub-heading

1.1.1 Content
By deafult, the content nodes must be multiple lines. The second line will set [text] property
The third and the rest of the lines can either set [notes] property or be joined to the [text] property - depending on the [extractNotes] configuration.

1.2 Multiple line heading node //{ "type":"heading" }
This is an example of overwriting the node type setting. The second lines, by default, are saved in [text] property.
The third lines and below are dealt as explained in 1.1.1 above.

1.2.1 Single line content node //{ "type":"content" }

1.2.2 Content with cross-link
This is an example of cross-linked node to (1.1.1).
Cross-links are captrured only from the [text] properties. As this text is in the [notes], this reference (1.2.1) will not be taken to cross-links. 
However, if [extractNotes] is false, all lines will be set in the [text] property - see a sample below.

1.2.3 Content without notes //{ "extractNotes":false }
Here is a second line.
And third line that will be joined to the [text] property with a cross link to (1.2.2)
